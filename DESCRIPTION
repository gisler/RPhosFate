Title: Soil and Chemical Substance Emission and Transport Model
Version: 1.0.1
Authors@R: person("Gerold", "Hepp", email = "ghepp@iwag.tuwien.ac.at", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: An enhanced version of the semi-empirical, spatially distributed
    emission and transport model PhosFate implemented in R and C++. It currently
    supports suspended solids (SS) and particulate phosphorus (PP). A major
    feature is the allocation of substance loads entering surface waters to
    their sources of origin, which is a basic requirement for the identification
    of critical source areas and in consequence a cost-effective implementation
    of mitigation measures.
